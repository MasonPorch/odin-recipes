    <h2>Beautiful homemade pizza</h2>
    <p>Homemade pizza is a delightful, hands-on culinary creation that brings the warmth of the kitchen to life. It starts with a soft, yeasty dough stretched into a perfect circle, its edges slightly puffed and ready to crisp. The base is brushed with a vibrant, tangy tomato sauce made from ripe, crushed tomatoes, seasoned with a hint of garlic, oregano, and basil. A generous layer of gooey, melted mozzarella cheese blankets the sauce, dotted with toppings like spicy pepperoni, colorful bell peppers, earthy mushrooms, or whatever the heart desires. Baked to golden perfection in a hot oven, the crust emerges crisp on the outside yet chewy within, while the aromas of herbs and sizzling toppings fill the air. Each slice is a personalized masterpiece, bursting with fresh, bold flavors and the satisfaction of being made from scratch.</p>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
        <li>Make the dough: Dissolve yeast in lukewarm water in a small bowl. Let stand until creamy, about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Combine flour, shortening, and salt in a large bowl; add yeast mixture and stir until dough comes together. Knead dough on a lightly floured surface until smooth and elastic, about 8 minutes.</li>
        <li>Lightly oil a large bowl. Place dough into the bowl and turn to coat with oil. Cover with a damp cloth and let rise in a warm place until doubled in volume, about 45 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, make the sauce: Heat oil in a small saucepan over medium heat. Add onion and sauté until tender, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir in tomato paste, water, salt, sugar, oregano, garlic powder, basil, marjoram, cumin, chili powder, red pepper flakes, and black pepper; simmer for 15 to 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Divide dough in half. Roll each half into a 12-inch circle. Place dough onto two 12-inch pizza pans; cover with sauce and mozzarella cheese.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until crusts are golden brown, about 20 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
