    <h2>Cooked dish of alfredo</h2>
    <p>Alfredo is a classic Italian-American dish featuring a rich, creamy sauce made from butter, heavy cream, and freshly grated Parmesan cheese. The sauce is gently heated until it thickens, creating a velvety texture that coats tender pasta—often fettuccine—perfectly. Subtle hints of garlic, black pepper, and sometimes a pinch of nutmeg enhance its luxurious flavor. This indulgent dish is typically garnished with a sprinkle of extra Parmesan and fresh parsley, offering a comforting and satisfying meal beloved for its simplicity and decadence.</p>
